The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "posgres".
This user must also own the server process.

The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_NZ.UTF-8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".

Data page checksums are disabled.

Enter new superuser password: 
Enter it again:

WARNING: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or
--auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

Success. You can now start the database server using:

    pg_ctl -D /pgdata/10.6 -l logfile start

### Restarted the database cluster

# sets environment variable
$ export PGDATA=/pgdata/10.6/cluster1/

# starts the server
$ /opt/pg/10.6/bin/pg_ctl -D /pgdata/10.6/cluster1 -l logfile start

### Working with extensions

# starts psql prompt
$ psql

# lists installed extensions
posgres=# \dx

# list available extensions
posgres=# SELECT name,comment FROM pg_available_extensions limit 5;

# when in psql prompt, I need to use the ';' at the end of the command

# created extension
posgres=# CREATE EXTENSION dblink;

# erased extension
posgres=# DROP EXTENSION dblink;
